# Dan's oh-my-zsh config

0.  Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and configure your
    terminal to use the installed font.

1.  Install [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)

        sudo apt install zsh

2.  Make `zsh` your default shell

        chsh -s $(which zsh)

    Note: if you wish to run this command with `sudo`, you have to specify
    the current user:

        sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) $USER

3.  Clone this repo **with all submodules** to `~`

        git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:dstockhammer/zsh.git ~/zsh

4.  Create a `.zshrc` that references the configuration in this repository

        echo 'source $HOME/zsh/.zshrc' > ~/.zshrc

5.  Switch to `zsh` and enjoy ðŸŒŸðŸ¦„ðŸŒŸ

        zsh

    Alternatively, if you're already using `zsh`, completely restart your shell.
    (**Do not** just reload your config with `source ~/.zshrc`)

6. Update ohmyzsh and all themes/plugins:

        ./scripts/update-deps.sh

### Browser integration

To configure WSL to open browser URLs in Windows, you can use the `wslview` utility, which is a part of the `wslu` package.

    sudo apt install wslu

Configure `wslview` to open your browser of choice in Windows. Here is an example for Firefox:

    wslview -r $(wslpath -au 'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe')
